# Assignment 1-3: Infinite Skills

# Before this course, I have done some basic programming.
# I have practiced small Python exercises, like printing messages and using variables.
# I have also tried very simple projects like creating a calculator or a guessing game.
# These experiences help me because I already know how to write code and test it.
# I understand basic concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions.
# This will help me in this course to learn faster and try more advanced exercises.
